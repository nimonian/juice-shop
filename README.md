OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web
application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as
a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many
other security flaws found in real-world applications!
